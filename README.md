Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) using CNN and OpenCV is a system designed to automatically convert handwritten text into digital text. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and recognize patterns in handwritten characters. OpenCV is utilized for image processing tasks such as preprocessing and segmentation to enhance the quality of the input images. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters to learn their features and variations. When presented with an input image containing handwritten text, the system applies the trained CNN model to classify and transcribe the characters into machine-readable text, providing an efficient solution for digitizing handwritten documents.
